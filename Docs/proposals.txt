Group 6 Project Proposals: Noah, Guanzhang, Kamoltat, Tiam

Project Idea 1: 

Our primary idea consists of creating an application that would utilize the spotify api 
to get a users playlist, and can generate an audio visualizer. We would also use a database that contains 
the images of covers that would be either the audio visualizer itself or in the background. This application would be 
mainly used when someone is having people over, and wants a visual available in addition to the music. 
Here is a link to an example (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8XIgR5OGJc)



Project Idea 2: 

Our second choice for a project would be a travel site that would 
provide recommendations for various activities to do in Boston. These 
activities can vary from Historical sites and local attractions, restaurants, 
night life,and event such as concerts. We would utilize various api's such as Google Maps, Yelp, 
eventbrite, and weather api in gathering data and aiding in creating recommendations.
